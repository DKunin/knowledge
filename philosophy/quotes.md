# Цитаты

## Лао Цзю
Если ты подавлен - ты живешь прошлым.  
Если ты волнуешься - ты живешь будущим.  
Если ты спокоен - ты живешь настоящим.  

## Stoics

This is the price I am willing to pay for retaining my composure.  
I want to do these things but I also want more to keep my mind in harmony with nature.
You are just an impression and not at all the things you claim to   represent.
It is nothing to me.  
That’s his opinion. / It seems right to him.  

## Ryan Holiday, Ego is the Enemy
When we remove ego, we’re left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility, yes—but rock-hard humility and confidence. Whereas ego is artificial, this type of confidence can hold weight. Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned.

## Isaac Asimov
If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.  
If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster.

## Albert Einstein
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough

## H.P. Lovecraft
In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulu waits dreaming

## Misc

Those who say it can’t be done shouldn’t interrupt those who are doing it.

There are no victims of fate, only those, who choose to surrender.
Fate has no victims, only those who willingly surrender to it.

In brightest day, in blackest night,  
No evil shall escape my sight  
Let those who worship evil's might,  
Beware my power... Green Lantern's light!  

Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll know,
Live and die on this day, live and die on this day.

If you can't protect the integrity of the system, then there is no system.

Our goal should not be “it renders, therefore it must be right”, instead it should be “this is clean, extensible and it uses various technologies benefiting of their different strengths”.
