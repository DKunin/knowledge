	- good air condition between 40-60 % relative humidity
	- 20 degrees celc
- what is the best time to open the window
- How long should be window opened (different opinions)
- Can't control the heat

- What do I need to answer the question

# Humidity 
- people raise humidity of the room

# Temperature
- Several sensors, the more the better

Math

	f=mw/V
	y=f/fmax
	f=humidity
	V=room volume
	y=phi, relative humidity

# Go to arduino
- Humidity sensor
- Page from instructubles
- Many tutorials
- Raspberry pi - more expensive

# Limitations
# Thermo Dynamics

Be aware that you have to focus on a certain domain, think about limitations and stuff

- Push or pull the data
- decided on pushing the data
- indemendent server implementation, just an endpoint

# Add external sources
- more data, more sensors

# More ideas
- Assistant/alexa and stuff
